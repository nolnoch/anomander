## Anomander Theme

Inspired by the high-fantasy equivalent of "xXSephirothXx": Anomander Rake from Malazan Book of the Fallen series by Steven Erikson and Ian C. Esslemont.

Very dark, low-contrast theme anchored primarily in blue, green, and purple. Accents in white, gray, pink, and red to break up the monotony.

Syntax and symantic colouring based on C/C++. Works (but may not be currently ideal) for CMake, JSON, and Python.

Tested (and currently used) on four monitors, across Linux/Windows PC and MacBook Pro.

Uses color shades extensively, so **not ideal for colour-blindness**.

## Planned Features

Given the very tight range of colour and emphasis on shading, I plan to make 2-3 total versions for different light levels.

As I'm a hermit and like dark spaces, initial release is most suitable for darker conditions and monitors.

## Suggestions & Contributions

I am more than open to feedback, as I do want this to be as robust as possible, but this is a highly personal project, so I do not guarantee that all feedback will be incorporated.

You are more than welcome to fork, copy, or otherwise yank and iterate on it.

Happy coding!
