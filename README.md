Inspired by the epic, high-fantasy equivalent of "xXSephirothXx": [Anomander Rake](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Anomander_Rake) from [Malazan Book of the Fallen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen) series by Steven Erikson and Ian C. Esslemont.

Very dark, low-contrast theme anchored primarily in blue, green, and purple. Accents in white, gray, pink, and red to break up the monotony.

Syntax and symantic colouring based on C/C++ first and Python second. Works (but may not be currently ideal) for CMake, JSON, and Dockerfiles.

Tested (and currently used) on four monitors, across Linux/Windows PC and MacBook Pro.

Uses color shades extensively, so **<ins>not ideal for colour-blindness</ins>**.

## Planned Features

Given the very tight range of colour and emphasis on shading, I plan to make 2-3 total versions for different light levels.

As I'm a hermit and like dark spaces, initial release is most suitable for darker conditions and monitors.

## Suggestions & Contributions

I am more than open to feedback, as I do want this to be as robust as possible, but this is a highly personal project, so I do not guarantee that all feedback will be incorporated.

You are more than welcome to fork, copy, or otherwise yank and iterate on it.

Happy coding!
